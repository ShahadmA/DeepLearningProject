# Project Proposal

## Problem statement:

Recently, the phenomenon of smoking has spread among teenagers and adults. The spread of this phenomenon has led to a high death rate, because it causes many serious diseases, such as lung cancer and heart diseases. The system in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stipulates that smoking is prohibited in the places and squares surrounding mosques, ministries, government departments, public institutions and their branches, and educational, health, sports and cultural institutions, whether governmental or private, places designated for work in companies, institutions, bodies, factories, banks and the like, public transportation by land or air, places of food, food and beverages manufacturing, processing and packaging, petroleum production, transportation, distribution and refining, fuel and gas distribution and sale stations, warehouses, elevators and toilets The new system imposes a fine of 200 riyals for anyone who smokes in those areas. And the responsibility of controlling and editing violations and imposing financial fines on ministries, government departments, institutions, public bodies and their branches, other public agencies, educational, health, sports, cultural, social and charitable institutions, and institutions and facilities of the private sector and its branches. In this project, we are working on designing a system that monitors smoking violations through the use of artificial intelligence.

## Data Description:
The datasetâ€™s is a series of pictures. 

## Tools:

  ## MVP Goal:
  The goal of this project is:
  * Detecting infractions in public places, So we have customized this project to detect people smoking in prohibited places and the project will take a capture of this smoker to save in our system.

## Future work:
*	The model will be able to apply penalties.

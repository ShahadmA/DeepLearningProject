<h2> Abstract</h2>

the project is about how we can detect violationers of public taste and how the system can know if tied by violations.
 like smoking, contravenes of smoking in prohibited places
in our project we solve the smoking problem. 
our project can detect smokers and not smokers in live video.
we use <b>CNN</b> and transfer models like <b> ResNet50, InceptionV3, VGG19, MobileNet, VGG16, Yolo version 3. </b>
the Input data is images and the output is a detector in live video  
In this project we append the Yolo object detection model in Live Video demo and MobileNet in the website demo. 
We were able to provide a solution to detect the violationers of public taste which is run and start our system in surveillance cameras to detect smoker and saved in DB to make face recognition in Absher or Tawaklna Platforms to tied by the violation in smoker account.

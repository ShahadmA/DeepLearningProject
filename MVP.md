# Monitoring Violations of Public Taste using Artificial Intelligence

## MVP Goal:
Detecting infractions in public places, that is why we have done this project by working on the most important violations of public taste (smoking) to detect people smoking in prohibited places and the project will take a capture of this smoker to save in our system.


## CNN Model:

In CNN, the best accuracy in training was 90% and validation 77%.

## We used 2 transfer models :

* VGG19
* ResNet50
